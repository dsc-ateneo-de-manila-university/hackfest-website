        <p class="definition">
          The 48-hour hackathon proper will be further divided into two parts: 
          the Elimination Round and the Final Round. All teams will

          advance to the finals.
        </p>

          <h4 class="header-title" slot="header">Elimination Round</h4>
          <ul slot="details">
            <li>
              The prompt of the hackathon will be released before the 48-hour countdown begins. Time will be allotted for teams to meet and conceptualize their ideas.
            </li>
            <li>
              The criteria for the Elimination Round will be discussed right before the hackathon. This will be the only time when participants can ask the organizers questions regarding the criteria.
            </li>
            <li>
              The 48 hours will begin at exactly 1:00 PM on November 27, 2020. Teams are expected to have uploaded their code to GitHub and finalized their video presentation by the end of the 48 hours.
            </li>
            <li>
              Teams may use ideas they came up with before the hackathon proper but teams may only begin working on the product as soon as the 48 hours begin.
            </li>
            <li>
              Teams have full ownership of everything they create. However, given the terms in the application form, Developer Student Clubs Loyola reserves the right to showcase the projects with the team’s consent.
            </li>
            <li>
              Teams can use libraries and open-source frameworks for their products. The use of Google Developers Tools is encouraged.
            </li>
            <li>
              By the end of the 48 hours (1:00 PM, November 29, 2020), teams are required to have submitted the following:
              <ul slot="details">
                <li>
                  A video presentation (maximum of 5 minutes) succinctly demonstrating the notable and essential features of their product, the idea behind their work, and the problem/s they want to address. Participants must encapsulate everything they want to share within their video presentation. To avoid delays, we are requiring videos to be submitted in .mp4 format. [TeamName_ProductTitle.mp4]
                </li>
                <li>
                  A GitHub link containing their work. Teams cannot edit the code after submitting. Doing so calls for immediate disqualification. 
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
              Attendance to the Opening Ceremony is not required. However, teams will miss the chance to clarify some questions regarding the hackathon proper. Live updates (including the prompt, scheduling, and FAQs) will be posted on the event's official communication platforms. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Teams are allowed to ask the organizers questions regarding the flow during the 48 hours.

            <li>
              The 48-hour hackathon will start at its scheduled time regardless of the teams’ preparedness and availability. Any time lost by the teams is not a liability of the organizer.
            </li>
            <li>
              Unless the organizer deems a deadline extension to be necessary, appeals for an extension will not be entertained. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Judges will pick the top 10 teams based on the Elimination Criteria.
            </li>
            <li>
              The top 10 teams will be announced on November 29, 2020, after the 48th hour ends. The organizer will ask the chosen teams to prepare a 5-minute presentation for their product pitching on November 30, 2020. We give the team full discretion to choose the number of presenter/s.
